# 🔍 DeepFake Detection using CNN


## 🚀 Overview  
This project is a **DeepFake Detection** application powered by **Deep Learning**. It helps detect **AI-generated fake images** by analyzing subtle patterns that differentiate real and fake visuals. The application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of real and fake images.

The web-based interface allows users to:  
✅ **Upload an image for analysis**  
✅ **Get an instant DeepFake prediction (Real/Fake)**  
✅ **Explore research papers and blogs on DeepFake technology**  
✅ **Learn about the ethical implications of AI-generated content**  

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
- **DeepFakes pose a major threat** to misinformation, privacy, and digital security.  
- **AI-powered detection** can help combat manipulated media.  
- **Useful for journalists, researchers, and cybersecurity experts.**  

## 🌟 Features  
- **User-friendly web interface** for easy interaction.  
- **Real-time DeepFake prediction** with confidence scores.  
- **Supports PNG and JPG image formats.**  
- **Automatic image clearing** after analysis for a smooth workflow.  
- **Dedicated pages for AI Ethics, Research Papers, and Blogs.**  
- **Uses CNN for accurate classification.**  

## 🤖 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Core logic and model implementation)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning framework)  
- **Flask** (Web framework for deployment)  
- **Pillow** (Image processing)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Web UI development)

## 🏰 How It Works  
1. **User uploads an image** on the prediction page.  
2. **The model processes the image** and classifies it as **Real or Fake**.  
3. **The result is displayed** with a confidence score.  
4. **Uploaded images are cleared automatically** after processing.  
5. **Users can explore research papers, blogs, and ethical discussions on DeepFakes.**  

## 💪 Future Improvements  
- Improve model accuracy with **more advanced architectures (EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, etc.).**  
- Train on a **larger dataset covering diverse DeepFake techniques.**  
- Add **explainability features** to show why an image is classified as Fake.  
- Implement **video DeepFake detection** for more comprehensive analysis.  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms (AWS, Hugging Face, etc.)** for global accessibility.
